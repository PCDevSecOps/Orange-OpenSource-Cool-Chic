Cool-chic
=========


**Cool-chic** (pronounced /kul  Éik/ as in French ü•ñüßÄüç∑) is a low-complexity neural image and video codec based on overfitting. Image coding performance are on par with VVC for 2000 multiplication per decoded pixels, while video coding performance compete with AVC with as few as 500 multiplication per decoded pixels.

Version history
"""""""""""""""

* Fev. 24: version 3.1
    - Cool-chic video from `Cool-chic video: Learned video coding with 800 parameters, Leguay et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03179>`_
    - Random access and low-delay video coding, competitive with AVC.
* January 24: version 3.0
    - Implement some encoder-side improvements from `C3: High-performance and low-complexity neural compression from a single image or video, Kim et al <https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02753>`_
    - :doc:`15% to 20% rate decrease <./getting_started/results>` compared to Cool-chic 2
* July 23: version 2
    - Based on `Low-complexity Overfitted Neural Image Codec, Leguay et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12706>`_
    - Decoder changes: convolution-based synthesis, learnable upsampling module
    - Friendlier usage: support for YUV 420 input format in 8-bit and 10-bit & Fixed point arithmetic for cross-platform entropy (de)coding
* March 23: version 1
    - Based on `COOL-CHIC: Coordinate-based Low Complexity Hierarchical Image Codec, Ladune et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05458>`_


üèéÔ∏è üî• Up to come: a fast decoder implementation will be released soon for near real-time CPU decoding üèéÔ∏è üî•
